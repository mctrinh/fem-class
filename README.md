Python scripts and lecture notes of the graduate course: Finite Element Method. 

The course is delivered by Minh-Chien Trinh, Division of Mechanical System Engineering, @JBNU, South Korea.

Semesters: Spring 2022, Spring 2023

The finite element method is a powerful computer simulation tool that is widely used to solve practical problems in different engineering fields. In the field of structural and mechanical engineering, most design software and simulation tools utilize the finite element method and its variations. This course provides students with practical knowledge about mechanical and structural finite element analysis of solids and structures, finite element analysis of composites, and the application of Artificial Intelligence in engineering mechanics. Besides, Python codes will be provided such that students can use for further development and apply to their research works.
